# Open Stick Community - Product Page

This is a product landing page for the open stick community. It is meant to be a central location for all related links to the GP2040-CE firmware and partners.

## 🪄 Creators

For creators looking to be showcased as builders using GP2040-CE, you will need to create a fork of this repo. Once forked you will want to navigate to the [hardware.ts](/utils/hardware.ts).

## 🚀 Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
├── public/
│   └── favicon.svg
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── Card.astro
│   ├── layouts/
│   │   └── Layout.astro
│   └── pages/
│       └── index.astro
└── package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.
